Gaudete, gaudete Christus est natus; ex Maria virgine, gaudete

The choral tradition is to pronounce latin in a much more italianate style,
so really move your lips and particularly avoid English vowel sounds like the
'ay ee' we'd commonly use in the word day

Phoenetically

Gow deh teh, gow deh teh, crees toos est nah toos
ex Mar ee ah veer jin eh gow deh teh
